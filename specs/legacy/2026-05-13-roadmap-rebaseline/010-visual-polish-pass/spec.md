# Feature Specification: Visual Polish Pass — "Quiet Almanac" v1

**Legacy status (2026-05-13)**: Archived input for the roadmap rebaseline. This is not the active `010` Speckit source anymore, and visual polish is superseded by active `015-visual-refit` branch debt. During `docs/product-truth-reset`, preserve this draft under an archive/legacy path and reuse slot `010` for `010-agent-coordinator`.

**Feature Branch**: `010-visual-polish-pass`
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Last amended**: 2026-04-26 (cluster-suggestion card surface added after office-hours pivot)
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User feedback — "nice and functional but not up to par with sleek 2026 standards, especially for Notion/Asana-grade knowledge workers."
**Governing documents**: [.specify/memory/constitution.md](.specify/memory/constitution.md), [.specify/memory/design.md](.specify/memory/design.md)
**Depends on**: specs 001, 002 functional surfaces landed (capture, diary, envelope detail, trash, audit log, settings) **plus the v1 cluster-suggestion card surface (spec 002 2026-04-26 amendment) plus spec 012 (Resolution Semantics — defines the wax-seal fill states, italic resolution line, graduated visual fade, and resolution-event-entry typography that this spec implements)**. Does NOT depend on 003–009.
**Blocks**: none. This is a polish pass — behavioral specs remain authoritative for *what* each surface does; this spec binds *how it looks, moves, and feels*.

---

## Why This Spec Exists

[.specify/memory/design.md](.specify/memory/design.md) v1.0 already ratifies Orbit's visual identity (the "Quiet Almanac" — daybook typography, wax-seal intent glyphs, left-margin time rail, paper-grain overlay, zero Material icons). Every Compose task in specs 001–002 was scoped as *"land the functional behavior; defer visual polish to a dedicated slice."* That slice has never existed.

Consequences visible today:
- Plain Material 3 defaults everywhere (purple `primary`, default roboto, standard elevation shadows, filter chips for intent).
- No paper-grain texture, no cream/graphite tokens, no editorial typography.
- No wax-seal glyphs — intent is rendered as `Text("WANT_IT")` or default-styled chips.
- Material `Icons.Filled.*` used throughout the Trash, Audit, Envelope Detail, Settings, Diary day-nav surfaces — in direct violation of design.md §2 ("Zero Material icons. Every affordance is either typography or one of the four wax seals").

Target audience (knowledge workers fluent in Notion, Asana, Linear, Arc, Things) expect deliberate typography, measured motion, and a strong product voice. The current UI reads as "technically working prototype," not "a product I want to live in."

## Non-Goals (v1 polish pass)

- ~~No new functional surfaces. Existing screens keep their current information architecture.~~ **AMENDED 2026-04-26:** The v1 cluster-suggestion card is a new functional surface that lands inside this polish window. It is NOT a Figma redesign — it's a card that surfaces inside the existing Diary information architecture. See User Story 5 + FR-010-018 onward.
- No Figma redesign of flows. We execute the already-ratified design.md and extend it ONLY for the cluster-suggestion card.
- No animation library (Lottie/Compose-Animatable complex choreography). Motion is subtle and Compose-native only.
- No dark-mode rework — design.md §3 defines both palettes; v1 ships both with parity.
- No custom webfonts requiring network fetch (violates Principle I). Bundled fonts only.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 — "This looks like Orbit, not a stock Android app" (Priority: P1)

As a returning user, I open the diary and immediately perceive the product's personality: a cream (or graphite, in dark mode) page with a subtle paper grain, a serif day-header paragraph at the top, monospace timestamps hanging in the left margin, envelope cards rendered as ruled editorial entries, and four wax-seal glyphs marking each envelope's intent. The screen breathes — nothing competes for my attention, the hierarchy reads as effortlessly as a well-set magazine.

**Why P1**: The product's defensive moat is trust + aesthetic specificity. Without the visual identity, Orbit is "another screenshot-catcher with a local DB." With it, Orbit is *the daybook app*.

**Acceptance**:
1. **Given** the diary is open on today's page, **When** I look at the top of the screen, **Then** I see the day paragraph set in the spec'd serif face at the spec'd size/leading, with the date in monospace labelmedium above it.
2. **Given** at least one envelope exists, **When** I look at the card, **Then** I see a wax-seal glyph (▲/◆/●/○) in the spec'd accent ink corresponding to its intent, NOT a Material chip or filter pill.
3. **Given** the diary scrolls, **When** it reaches the top, **Then** the paper-grain overlay remains visible at 4% opacity without banding or moiré at 120 Hz.
4. **Given** a screenshot is taken and compared against the design.md §4.2 reference mock, **Then** typography scale, margin widths, and line heights match within ±2 dp.

### User Story 2 — "Motion feels choreographed, not janky" (P1)

As a user tapping the bubble → capture sheet → chip-row → diary entry, I experience a single continuous entrance: bubble expands into sheet with a gentle arc easing, chip row fades in with a measured 120 ms stagger, the new envelope appears in the diary with a brief ink-bleed fade, not a Material slide. Reduce-motion users get static fades of the same duration.

**Why P1**: Knowledge-worker apps (Things, Linear, Arc) treat motion as a first-class product quality. Orbit's "two-second capture experience" (Principle II) deserves as much.

**Acceptance**:
1. All entrance animations respect `Settings.Global.ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` multiplier.
2. Reduce-motion system preference disables directional motion in favor of fades ≤160 ms.
3. No Material default spring — all easings use one of two design.md §7 curves (entrance, settle).
4. No dropped frames on Pixel 8 / Galaxy S24 during the bubble→sheet→diary path (gate: `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` with a Jank reporter budget).

### User Story 3 — "Every screen speaks the same language" (P1)

As a user navigating between diary → envelope detail → trash → audit log → settings, I notice the shared primitives: the same top-app-bar density, the same ruled dividers, the same intent glyph rendering, the same typography ramp. Nothing feels like "that one screen that looks different."

**Why P1**: Internal consistency IS the product. A single Material-default screen breaks the illusion.

**Acceptance**:
1. Every Compose screen imports from `com.orbit.app.ui.theme.*` (tokens) and `com.orbit.app.ui.primitives.*` (shared components). No screen-local color, typography, or elevation constants.
2. No direct `androidx.compose.material.icons.*` imports outside `/ui/primitives/WaxSeal.kt`, `/ui/primitives/TypoGlyphs.kt`, and the launcher icon resource.
3. Lint rule `OrbitMaterialIconUsage` fires on any rogue Material-icon import introduced after this pass.

### User Story 5 — "The cluster-suggestion card feels native to the Quiet Almanac" (P1, added 2026-04-26)

As a user opening the Diary the morning after a research-session cluster forms, I see a single card at the top of today's page (above the day-header on cluster days) that doesn't shout for attention. It's framed by ruled dividers consistent with envelope cards, carries a subtle "agent voice" treatment (the **✦** wax-seal-style mark, locked /autoplan 2026-04-26, distinguishing it from envelope cards but in the same visual family), and offers 1–3 inline action affordances rendered in **Geist 14 sp regular weight, sentence case** with hairline-rule separators (revised /autoplan 2026-04-26 — see FR-010-020).

**Why P1**: this is the first surface in the entire product where the *agent speaks*. If it looks like a Material 3 ChatGPT bubble, the Quiet Almanac collapses. If it looks native to the daybook, it's the demo's wow moment AND a permanent product surface that won't ever feel grafted on.

**Acceptance**:
1. **Given** a research-session cluster has formed overnight, **When** I open the diary, **Then** I see one cluster-suggestion card at the top of today's page (above the day-header paragraph), set in the spec'd serif, framed by ruled dividers consistent with envelope cards.
2. **Given** the cluster-suggestion card is visible, **When** I look at the action affordances (D-NARROW v1 ships **Summarize** only; D-AS-WRITTEN stretch adds Open All + Save as List), **Then** they render in Geist 14 sp regular weight sentence case with no Material button chrome, separated by **vertical hairline rules `│`** (per FR-010-020 — mid-dots banned because they are the metadata separator elsewhere in the product).
3. **Given** the card includes a "from the agent" mark, **When** I look at it, **Then** I see the **✦** glyph (locked /autoplan 2026-04-26), distinct from the four envelope-intent glyphs (▲/◆/●/○) — reserved exclusively for agent voice and lint-enforced via `NoAgentVoiceMarkOutsideAgentSurfaces` (per FR-010-019).
4. **Given** I dismiss the card with a swipe or tap-to-dismiss, **When** I return to the diary, **Then** the card does not reappear for the same cluster (one-shot per cluster per day).
5. **Given** my system has reduce-motion enabled, **When** the card surfaces, **Then** it fades in over the design.md §7 short duration with no directional motion.

### User Story 4 — "The app is readable at every accessibility scale" (P1)

As a user with large system font sizes (130%+) or a color-vision deficiency (protanopia/deuteranopia), I can still parse every screen: intent is carried by glyph **shape** (▲/◆/●/○) first and accent ink second, typography respects system scale, contrast meets WCAG AA across both palettes.

**Why P1**: Principle IV (intent before artifact) is useless if the intent indicator is unreadable to 8% of the population. Knowledge workers also skew older and do use system font scale.

**Acceptance**:
1. All text respects `FontSizeOverride` at 85%/100%/115%/130% without overflow on a 360 dp screen.
2. All text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 body, 3:1 headlines) on both cream and graphite palettes.
3. Intent wax-seal glyphs are distinguishable at 100% zoom without color (verified via desaturated screenshot diff).

## Functional Requirements

**Design token layer** (in `app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/ui/theme/`):
- **FR-010-001**: System MUST centralize color in `OrbitColorTokens.kt` with cream (light) + graphite (dark) palettes per design.md §3. No direct `Color(0xFF...)` outside this file and `Colors.xml` resources.
- **FR-010-002**: System MUST centralize typography in `OrbitTypography.kt` with a bundled serif (day-header, envelope summary) and a bundled monospace (margins, action labels) per design.md §5. No web-font fetch.
- **FR-010-003**: System MUST centralize elevation, shape, and spacing in `OrbitShapes.kt` + `OrbitSpacing.kt`. Elevation is near-zero — design.md §6 forbids drop-shadow hierarchy; separation is achieved via ruled dividers and spacing.
- **FR-010-004**: System MUST provide `OrbitMotion.kt` with two named easings (entrance, settle) and four canonical durations (instant=80 ms, short=160 ms, medium=240 ms, long=360 ms). Reduce-motion system preference substitutes fade-only variants.

**Shared primitive layer** (in `app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/ui/primitives/`):
- **FR-010-005**: System MUST ship a `WaxSeal(intent: Intent, size: Dp)` composable rendering ▲ (WANT_IT) / ◆ (FOR_LATER) / ● (REFERENCE) / ○ (AMBIGUOUS) in the intent's accent ink. No PNG assets — glyphs are drawn as typographic characters with a custom `FontFamily` OR via `Canvas.drawPath`.
- **FR-010-006**: System MUST ship `OrbitTopAppBar`, `OrbitDivider`, `OrbitCard`, `OrbitPagerButton` primitives that every screen consumes instead of Material 3 defaults.
- **FR-010-007**: System MUST ship `PaperGrain` modifier that overlays a 4%-opacity bundled PNG (≤16 KB) on any `Surface`. The overlay respects dark/light palette parity.
- **FR-010-008**: System MUST ship `TimeMargin(time: LocalTime)` composable for the left-margin monospace timestamp. Renders right-aligned in a fixed 56 dp rail per design.md §4.1.

**Screen migrations** (every existing Compose surface):
- **FR-010-009**: System MUST migrate [DiaryScreen](app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/diary/ui/DiaryScreen.kt), [EnvelopeDetailScreen](app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/diary/ui/EnvelopeDetailScreen.kt), [TrashScreen](app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/settings/TrashScreen.kt), [AuditLogScreen](app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/audit/AuditLogScreen.kt), [SettingsScreen](app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/settings/SettingsScreen.kt), and the Overlay capture sheet to consume the token + primitive layer. No Material 3 defaults remain.
- **FR-010-010**: System MUST migrate the Diary's day-nav bar (`Older day ‹` / `› Newer day`) to `OrbitPagerButton` with typographic glyphs (`‹`/`›`) instead of `Icons.Filled.ChevronLeft`/`Right`.
- **FR-010-011**: System MUST migrate intent display on EnvelopeCard, EnvelopeDetail header, and chip row from FilterChip to `WaxSeal`. Chip row becomes a row of four tappable wax seals labeled by typography below.

**Lint enforcement**:
- **FR-010-012**: System MUST ship lint rule `OrbitMaterialIconUsage` (in `build-logic/lint/`) that fires on any `androidx.compose.material.icons.*` import from any file outside the approved primitive allow-list. Severity ERROR in CI.
- **FR-010-013**: System MUST ship lint rule `OrbitRawColorUsage` that fires on `Color(0xFF...)` literals outside `OrbitColorTokens.kt`.

**Accessibility gates**:
- **FR-010-014**: System MUST pass a desaturated-screenshot diff test proving intent glyphs remain distinguishable without color.
- **FR-010-015**: System MUST pass WCAG AA contrast ratio verification in a `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` JVM test over the full token palette × typography ramp cross-product.
- **FR-010-016**: All touch targets MUST be ≥48 dp (Android baseline) even when the visual asset is smaller (wax seal glyph at 24 dp with 12 dp padding on each side).

**Golden tests**:
- **FR-010-017**: System MUST ship Paparazzi (or Roborazzi) golden tests for: DiaryScreen Ready state, DiaryScreen Empty state, **DiaryScreen with cluster-suggestion card visible (research-session)**, EnvelopeDetailScreen Ready, TrashScreen with 3 items, AuditLogScreen with groupings, SettingsScreen. Both palettes × both font scales (100% + 130%). Goldens checked into repo.

**Cluster-suggestion card primitives (added 2026-04-26)**:
- **FR-010-018**: System MUST ship a `ClusterSuggestionCard(cluster: ClusterRef, actions: List<ClusterAction>)` primitive in `app/src/main/java/com/orbit/app/ui/primitives/`. The card consumes the existing token + primitive layer (FR-010-001 through FR-010-008). No new color tokens.
- **FR-010-019** (revised /autoplan 2026-04-26): System MUST ship an `AgentVoiceMark` glyph **locked to ✦ (six-pointed star)**, distinct from the four envelope-intent wax seals. Rendered via the same `Canvas.drawPath` mechanism as `WaxSeal` (FR-010-005), at 14 sp in `--ink-accent-cluster` (a new accent token). Reserved exclusively for agent-spoken surfaces — no other component may render this glyph in v1. **Lint allow-list**: `build-logic/lint/` MUST gain a `NoAgentVoiceMarkOutsideAgentSurfaces` detector (sibling to `NoHttpClientOutsideNet`) that fails the build if `AgentVoiceMark` is referenced from any file outside the agent-voice surface allow-list (initially: `ClusterSuggestionCard.kt` only).
- **FR-010-020** (revised /autoplan 2026-04-26): System MUST ship a `ClusterActionRow(actions: List<ClusterAction>)` primitive. Renders 2–3 action labels in **Geist 14 sp regular weight, sentence case** in `--ink` (revised from "monospace caps in `--ink-dim`" — small caps at 12 sp disappears at 4K projection and reads as "publication subtitle" rather than "agent call-to-action"). Action labels separated by **vertical hairline rules `│`** (1 px, `--rule` color, height matches cap-height) — NOT mid-dots. Mid-dot (`·`) is reserved for the metadata separator elsewhere in the product (§4.6 envelope card, §4.7 settings); reusing it in the action row would teach users this row is metadata, not actions. Touch targets ≥48 dp per FR-010-016. No Material button chrome. Example rendering: `Summarize │ Open all │ Save as list`.
- **FR-010-021** (revised /autoplan 2026-04-26 UC2 Option A): System MUST integrate `ClusterSuggestionCard` into `DiaryScreen` (FR-010-009 migration list) **above the day-header paragraph on cluster days** (revised from "between day-header and thin rule, NOT above"). On cluster days the cluster card is the day's event-hero; the day-header is steady-state. Events outrank steady-state in attention hierarchy. **On non-cluster days, placement is unchanged** — day header runs straight into thin rule; no card means no slot. ONLY rendered on days where a cluster formed overnight. Stacks vertically if multiple clusters formed (max 2 cards per day in v1; further deferred to v1.1).
- **FR-010-022**: System MUST persist card-dismissed state per (cluster_id, day_local) so a dismissed card doesn't reappear on the same day's diary view. **Dismissal trace** (added /autoplan 2026-04-26): on dismissal the card collapses leaving a single-line trace at the same Diary position — Berkeley Mono 10 sp `--ink-faint`, `Cluster dismissed · 9:14A`. Persistent for the day. Honest signal that dismissal was received (no false "agent learned" claim); auditable (matches `audit_log` surface §4.8).
- **FR-010-023**: System MUST add an integration test `DiaryClusterSuggestionCardTest` covering: card renders for a cluster, dismissal persists across navigation, action labels are tappable and route to the correct handler, card respects reduce-motion preference, dismissal-trace renders + persists.

**Cluster-suggestion card states (added /autoplan 2026-04-26)**:
- **FR-010-024**: System MUST render `ClusterSuggestionCard` in 6 states. **SURFACED** (default): ✦ + body italic + action row with hairline rules. **ACTING** (during Nano 4 inference, ~2-3 s after Summarize tap): action labels replaced by Newsreader italic 14 sp ellipsis cycling at 600 ms intervals; ✦ does not animate (remains anchored). No spinner, no skeleton shimmer (Material chrome banned). **FAILED** (Nano returns error/null/timeout): body copy replaced by Newsreader italic 16 sp `Orbit couldn't reach all 4 captures. Try again?` with a single ↻ retry affordance in the action row position. After 3 retries: Berkeley Mono 10 sp `--ink-faint` `Retried. Try again later, or open captures individually.` **STALE** (>6 h old when user opens Orbit): action row's right margin gains a Berkeley Mono 10 sp `· 9:14A` timestamp marker in `--ink-faint`. **REPEAT-TAP**: 1 s debounce; second tap during ACTING is a visual no-op (ellipsis continues). **SLOW-NETWORK** (one or more constituent URL captures never hydrated): body soft-degrades to `3 of 4 captures synthesized. The 4th couldn't be reached.` — the card never lies about coverage.

**Cluster-suggestion card output (added /autoplan 2026-04-26)**:
- **FR-010-025** (citations required): Summarize bullet output MUST include source-envelope citations rendered as Berkeley Mono 10 sp `--ink-faint` trailing superscripts (e.g., `…Founder Mode four times. ¹²³`) where ¹²³ are 1-indexed references to the cluster's member envelopes, listed at card foot in metadata-strip style (`¹ medium.com/founder-mode  ²  twitter.com/…  ³ podcast.fm/…`). Bullets without citations MUST be rejected by `ClusterSummariser` and the card MUST transition to FAILED state. This is the structural answer to hallucinated synthesis on stage — no uncited bullets render, ever.
- **FR-010-026** (output bounds): Bullet output is bounded ≤3 bullets, each ≤240 characters. If Nano output exceeds either bound, truncate and append `…`. The card has no max-height — it grows to fit ≤3 bullets.

---

## Success Criteria

- **SC-010-1**: A screenshot of DiaryScreen shown to 5 product-oriented people, 4+ correctly identify it as "deliberate / editorial / daybook-like" (not "default Android app").
- **SC-010-2**: Zero Material icon imports remain outside the approved allow-list. Lint gates enforce.
- **SC-010-3**: WCAG AA contrast verified across 100% of text/background pairs in both palettes.
- **SC-010-4**: Paparazzi golden tests pass on CI; any visual diff requires a human reviewer to approve the new golden.
- **SC-010-5**: First-paint latency on DiaryScreen remains ≤450 ms cold-start on Pixel 8 (no regression from functional baseline).

---

## Out of Scope / Post-v1

- Haptic choreography (Android 12+ `HapticFeedback` per surface).
- Widget glance surfaces.
- Adaptive palette (Material You dynamic color) — deliberately excluded; Orbit's palette is product identity, not user-themed.
- A dedicated onboarding visual pass (separate spec).

---

## Open Questions

- **D1**: Do we bundle a custom serif (e.g., Source Serif Pro, iA Writer Quattro) or license a paid face? Custom → zero cost but generic; paid → brand-tier look. Recommendation: ship with a well-set free face (e.g., *Source Serif 4*, OFL) in v1; revisit at v1.3.
- **D2**: Wax-seal rendering — typographic character (`FontFamily`) or `Canvas.drawPath`? Path gives pixel-perfect control + color flexibility; font gives cheap rendering + free accessibility labels. Recommendation: path, wrapped in `semantics { contentDescription = "…" }`.
- **D3**: Golden-test framework — Paparazzi (JVM, fast) or Roborazzi (Robolectric-backed, more accurate Compose)? Recommendation: Paparazzi for speed + a minimal Roborazzi pass on the capture-sheet overlay path only.
- **D4 (added 2026-04-26, RESOLVED 2026-04-26 via /autoplan)**: `AgentVoiceMark` glyph locked to **✦ (six-pointed star)** at 14 sp in `--ink-accent-cluster`. Rationale: tonally compatible with the wax-seal vocabulary (small, drawn, ink-like) but visually distinct (radial vs. solid). Lint allow-list `NoAgentVoiceMarkOutsideAgentSurfaces` enforces exclusivity per FR-010-019.
- **Amendment 2026-04-29 (spec 015 visual-refit):** AgentVoiceMark color consolidates with the brand amber accent (`#e8b06a` / `BrandAccent`). The previously reserved `--ink-accent-cluster` token is retired. Single-accent rationale: the ✦ glyph carries symbolic weight; a separate color was load-bearing only when "agent voice" needed to register against a non-amber palette. The visual refit unifies on amber, and the ✦ remains the agent-voice marker via shape, not color.
- **D5 (added 2026-04-26)**: Cluster-card stacking with per-envelope Orbit Actions chips (spec 003) — when both surface on the same day, how do they visually relate? Option A: cluster card always at top, per-envelope chips inline under their envelopes (parallel hierarchies). Option B: a unified "actionable" lane to the side. Recommendation: A in v1 (cleaner), defer B as v1.1 explorationfor when Orbit Actions ships. Spec 003 also flags this question.
- **D6 (added 2026-04-26, RESOLVED + REVISED 2026-04-26 via /autoplan UC2)**: Where in design.md does the cluster-suggestion card live? **Initial resolution (morning 2026-04-26)**: design.md gained §4.5.1 as a sub-section of §4.5, with placement between Day header and Thin rule. **Revised (autoplan 2026-04-26 UC2 Option A)**: card placement inverted — on cluster days, card renders ABOVE the day-header paragraph. The cluster card is the day's event-hero; the day-header is steady-state. Events outrank steady-state in attention hierarchy. On non-cluster days, placement is unchanged (no card, no slot). Italic Newsreader is the agent-voice tonal mark.

**Amendment 2026-04-29 (spec 002 Phase 11 Block 8):** Adds DismissedTrace as a 7th render variant beyond the 6 enumerated above. Persists the post-dismissal mono trace at the same Diary slot so dismissal is honestly auditable for the day. Sealed-class member with default-empty `headerLabel`/`timeRangeLabel`/`sourceCategories` so the slot can hold any state.
