# Specification Quality Checklist: Intent Set Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-29
**Feature**: spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  
  _Spec describes intent set, mapping, audit behavior; planning artifacts (plan.md, tasks.md) carry the implementation specifics._
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs  
  _Each active user story names the alpha-user impact: chip palette correctness, existing capture preservation, and cloud classifier alignment._
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders  
  _The three active user stories and deferred ContactRef follow-up read in plain language; FR list and Key Entities use minimal jargon._
- [x] All mandatory sections completed  
  _User Scenarios & Testing, Edge Cases, Requirements (FR-016-001..010), Key Entities, Success Criteria all populated._

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
  _Every FR maps to a verification task in tasks.md (see verification matrix at the end of tasks.md)._
- [x] Success criteria are measurable  
  _SC-016-001..006 reference observable outcomes: stored intent preservation, chip labels/order, classifier labels, unknown-label fallback, deferred ContactRef scope, and verification gates._
- [x] Success criteria are appropriately scoped  
  _User-visible behavior is primary; build/test gates are tracked as implementation readiness criteria for this cross-tree Android + Supabase change._
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined  
  _Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios._
- [x] Edge cases are identified  
  _Unknown intent fallback, stale rename text, non-pickable `AMBIGUOUS`, and deferred ContactRef absence are listed._
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded  
  _Out of Scope explicitly defers ContactRef schema, contact-picker UI, multi-recipient UI, visual styling, and label renames._
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified  
  _Spec 015 dependency posture documented in Assumptions; cluster-engine independence and AIDL string-typed surface verified by audit and recorded in research.md._

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria  
  _Each FR is paired with a verifying task in tasks.md verification matrix._
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows  
  _Existing-user preservation (P1), chip palette/order (P1), cloud classifier alignment (P1), and deferred ContactRef scope._
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria  
  _SC-016-001..006 are observable post-implementation._
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification  
  _Implementation specifics (Migration class names, SQL, Compose icon choices) live in plan.md and tasks.md, not spec.md._

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- All items pass on first review. No clarifications outstanding — user resolved all open questions in the kickoff brief (see "RESOLVED DECISIONS" in the planning prompt).
