# Feature Specification: Visual Refit (Quiet Almanac)

**Feature Branch**: `015-visual-refit`
**Created**: 2026-04-29
**Status**: Implementation in progress — Phase 0 landed; Phase 1+ worktree split pending
**Input**: Off-platform design exploration "Quiet Almanac" (deep navy ground,
cream type, amber accent, Cormorant Garamond serif italic for emphasis,
JetBrains Mono captions). Bundle checked into
`design/visual-refit-2026-04-29/`.

## Summary

Adopt a new visual language across the Android Compose codebase as a presentation-only
refit. The refit is feature-flagged (`RuntimeFlags.useNewVisualLanguage`, default
OFF), shipped behind 5 phases with a Claude review gate after every commit, and
**builds on** the Phase 11 Block 7 primitives (`AgentVoiceMark`,
`ClusterActionRow`, `CapsulePalette`) — it does not replace them.

No data model changes. No ViewModel signature changes. Every refit composable
calls the same upstream methods its predecessor calls.

## Locked Decisions (Non-Negotiable)

These were resolved before spec authoring. Do not relitigate during implementation.

- **LD-001 — Single brand accent: amber (#e8b06a).** A new `BrandAccent` token
  consolidates with `AgentVoiceMark`'s existing `--ink-accent-cluster`
  (#3D4A6B / #8FA3CC). The ✦ glyph keeps its symbolic role; only its color
  changes. Spec 010 D4 receives an amendment entry recording this consolidation.
- **LD-002 — Intent set is `[want it, reference, read later, for someone, interesting]`.**
  Preserve the product labels `Want it` and `Interesting`; add `Read later` as
  the fifth pickable intent. Drop "in orbit" (vague) and "archive" (not a
  save-time intent). The "for someone" intent enables a contact-picker layer.
  *Schema migration to enforce this at the data layer is a SEPARATE concern —
  see Dependencies below.*
- **LD-003 — No "sealed at save" wording.** Public framing is
  "reclassify adds a layer, latest visible." `intentHistoryJson` remains
  append-only at the data layer; only user-facing copy changes.
- **LD-004 — Local-AI hardware phrasing is**
  "for local-model-capable phones (Pixel 8 Pro+, Galaxy S24+, capable hardware)".
  Not "Pixel 8 and up."
- **LD-005 — Bubble overlay refit is in scope before Demo Day.**
  Visual quality matters for the primary capture affordance. Phase 5 should
  refit the working bubble to the Orbit mark language behind the visual flag,
  while preserving tap/drag reliability and explicit accessibility checks.
- **LD-006 — Source glyphs are provider-first, origin-preserving.** When the
  captured content contains a strong provider URL (for example YouTube), that
  provider wins the primary glyph even if the foreground app was Brave,
  Messages, or another browser/share surface. The origin remains available for
  secondary copy such as `YouTube via Brave`.

## User Scenarios & Testing

This refit is presentation-only. There are no new user-facing capabilities; the
"users" of this feature are the team's design + engineering review loop and,
eventually, alpha testers behind the runtime flag.

### User Story 1 — Engineering can ship the refit incrementally without breaking alpha (Priority: P1)

A developer toggles `RuntimeFlags.useNewVisualLanguage` true on a debug build
and sees the new visual language across Diary, Cluster detail, Settings, and
Capture sheet. Toggling false returns to the existing visual language. No
crash, no missing strings, no broken navigation, no data corruption.

**Why this priority**: Without the flag gate, the refit either (a) has to land
all-at-once or (b) commits visible churn to alpha users mid-flight. The flag
makes Phase 0–4 landable independently.

**Independent Test**: Build debug APK on `015-visual-refit` after Phase 0
completes. Flip the flag at runtime; observe Phase 0 changes are token-only
and invisible (no screens touched yet). After each subsequent phase, the
corresponding screen visibly switches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** flag is OFF, **When** user opens Diary, **Then** the existing
   visual language renders and `:app:lintDebug` is clean.
2. **Given** flag is ON after Phase 1, **When** user opens a cluster card,
   **Then** the new `ClusterSuggestionCard` and `ClusterDetailScreen` render
   on the new tokens; ViewModel calls are unchanged.
3. **Given** flag is ON, **When** user reclassifies an envelope's intent,
   **Then** the UI shows "latest visible" framing (LD-003); the
   `intentHistoryJson` write is byte-identical to the flag-OFF path.

---

### User Story 2 — Designer/Claude can review each commit against the design bundle (Priority: P1)

After every commit on `015-visual-refit`, Claude (separate session) reviews
the diff against `design/visual-refit-2026-04-29/` reference JSX and either
approves or blocks the next commit.

**Why this priority**: This is the explicit gating mechanism the user
requested. Without it, the refit drifts.

**Independent Test**: Each Phase 0 commit ships independently; the next commit
does not start until Claude posts an approve.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Phase 0 commit 1 (tokens) lands, **When** Claude reviews,
   **Then** spec.md / commit body explicitly call out which JSX file the
   tokens map from, and the lint/compile gates are recorded in the commit body.
2. **Given** Claude blocks a commit, **When** the developer iterates,
   **Then** they amend or follow up with a fix commit on the same branch
   before proceeding.

---

### User Story 3 — Alpha tester sees a coherent refit when the flag flips on (Priority: P2)

When the team is satisfied the refit is complete (post-Phase 4), the flag
default flips to `true` (or alpha-only build wires `useNewVisualLanguage = true`)
and the four refitted surfaces (Diary, Cluster, Settings, Capture sheet)
render cohesively.

**Why this priority**: The actual user-visible payoff. Lower priority than
P1 stories because it gates on Phase 4 completion.

**Independent Test**: Manual screenshot sweep of the four screens with
flag = true vs the design bundle reference renders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all phases complete, **When** flag flips on, **Then** Diary,
  Cluster detail, Settings, Capture sheet, capture detail, and bubble overlay
  render in the new language behind the visual flag.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Flag flips mid-session**: existing screen instances may need recomposition;
  acceptable to require Activity restart for the boundary case in v1.
- **Font load failure**: `Cormorant Garamond` / `JetBrains Mono` fail to load
  → fall back to system serif / monospace; UI remains legible.
- **Dynamic color (Material You)**: refit uses fixed `BrandAccent`, not
  Material You. This is intentional — Quiet Almanac is a fixed palette.
- **Accessibility**: text contrast on `bgDeep` (#080b14) with `cream` (#f3ead8)
  must hit WCAG AA at body size; serif italic accent at WCAG AA min for body.
- **Existing screens during partial rollout**: when only Phase 1 has landed,
  flag-ON Diary still renders existing diary; only Cluster screens use new
  tokens. UX checks this is acceptable per phase.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-015-001**: System MUST add a `RuntimeFlags.useNewVisualLanguage: Boolean`
  flag, default `false`, in `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/RuntimeFlags.kt`.
  All refit composables MUST read this flag (or accept it as a parameter from
  a flag-aware host) before adopting new tokens.
- **FR-015-002**: System MUST add a `BrandAccent` token (`#e8b06a`),
  `BrandAccentDim` (16% alpha amber), and `BrandAccentInk` (`#1a1206`) to
  `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/ui/tokens/Colors.kt` as part of
  `CapsulePalette.Tokens`. (Per LD-001.)
- **FR-015-003**: System MUST consolidate `AgentVoiceMark`'s rendering color
  from `inkAccentCluster` to `brandAccent`. The lint detector
  `NoAgentVoiceMarkOutsideAgentSurfaces` and its test MUST be updated to
  reflect the consolidated color (test expectations only — detector logic
  unchanged). (Per LD-001.)
- **FR-015-004**: System MUST append a D4 amendment entry to
  `specs/010-visual-polish-pass/spec.md` (NOTE: tasks.md does not exist for
  spec 010 — see Dependencies for the contradiction surface) recording the
  consolidation: `inkAccentCluster` retired, `brandAccent` adopted.
- **FR-015-005**: System MUST add `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/ui/tokens/Type.kt`
  exposing typography stacks: display (`Cormorant Garamond`), body (`Inter`),
  caption (`JetBrains Mono`). Fonts MUST be wired via `app/src/main/res/font/`.
- **FR-015-006**: System MUST add the following Compose primitives to
  `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/ui/primitives/`:
  - `OrbitMark` — `Canvas` + `Path`, no font dependency. Mechanism mirrors
    `AgentVoiceMark`. Renders self-dot + tilted ellipse + accent dot.
  - `OrbitWordmark` — `OrbitMark` + serif "Orbit." text.
  - `MonoLabel` — uppercase tracked mono caption.
  - `IntentChip` — pill chip consuming the LD-002 5-intent palette.
  - `SourceGlyph` — round chip per app source (Twitter, Safari, Notes, …).
- **FR-015-007**: Refitted composables MUST NOT change the upstream method
  signatures or call paths into ViewModels. Every refit is a presentation-only
  swap.
- **FR-015-008**: Refit MUST NOT introduce migrations against the
  `IntentEnvelope` schema. The "drop in orbit / archive, add for someone"
  schema migration is referred out (see Dependencies).
- **FR-015-009**: Refit MUST NOT introduce the Slate / philosophy page or
  launch video into the Android app. Both belong on `orbitassistant.com` /
  press kit material.
- **FR-015-010**: Capture sheet refit (Phase 4) MUST NOT use "sealed at save"
  wording. Public framing is "reclassify adds a layer, latest visible."
  (Per LD-003.)
- **FR-015-011**: Settings danger-row copy MUST scope honestly: distinguish
  what Orbit controls (local data, on-device caches) vs what depends on
  third-party LLM-provider SLAs. (Per spec.md context for LD-004.)
- **FR-015-012**: Bubble overlay work MUST preserve tap/drag reliability,
  overlay touch bounds, and accessibility behavior while refitting to the Orbit
  mark language. (Per LD-005.)
- **FR-015-013**: A Claude-review gate MUST be enforced after every commit
  on `015-visual-refit` before the next commit lands. The gate is not
  automated; it is a manual checkpoint enumerated in `tasks.md` Phase 0.
- **FR-015-014**: Source glyph selection MUST be shared across Diary and Capture
  sheet. Provider URL detection MUST cover `youtube.com`, subdomains such as
  `m.youtube.com`, `youtu.be`, and `youtube-nocookie.com`; the same captured
  YouTube URL MUST render the same YouTube glyph regardless of foreground app.
- **FR-015-015**: Settings refit MUST include nested settings routes, not only
  the top-level Settings screen. User-facing product copy in settings routes
  MUST say `Orbit`; legacy `Capsule` copy is allowed only in package/process or
  developer-facing technical names.
- **FR-015-016**: Post-capture visual states (`ChipRow`, silent-save pill,
  undo pill, already-saved/confirmation pill) MUST have touch bounds that match
  their visible affordance. Full-width overlay hitboxes are allowed only for the
  chip row when the row visibly spans the screen.

### Key Entities

This feature has no new data entities. It exclusively touches the presentation
layer.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: `:app:compileDebugKotlin` is clean after every commit on
  `015-visual-refit`.
- **SC-002**: `:app:lintDebug` shows no new warnings beyond the pre-existing
  `MissingClass` for `ActionsSettingsActivity`.
- **SC-003**: `:build-logic:lint:test` is green (8/8) after Phase 0 commit 3
  consolidates `AgentVoiceMark` to brand accent. The
  `NoAgentVoiceMarkOutsideAgentSurfaces` allow-list is unchanged.
- **SC-004**: All existing instrumented tests for Diary, Cluster, Settings,
  and Capture sheet remain green with `useNewVisualLanguage = false`.
- **SC-005**: With `useNewVisualLanguage = true`, the four refitted screens
  match the design-bundle reference renders within tolerance documented in
  `research.md`. (Diff measured by hand-reviewed screenshot for v1.)
- **SC-006**: Zero changes to `IntentEnvelope` schema files / migrations on
  this branch.
- **SC-007**: Zero changes under `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/bubble/`
  on this branch.
- **SC-008**: Every commit on `015-visual-refit` records, in its commit body,
  the Claude review approval (or marker that approval was received).
- **SC-009**: On S24 and Tab S9 physical QA, two YouTube captures from different
  origins render with one consistent primary YouTube glyph in Diary and Capture
  sheet.
- **SC-010**: While the undo pill is visible, tapping an adjacent launcher/app
  icon outside the visible pill opens that app; only the visible pill intercepts
  touch.

## Assumptions

- Cormorant Garamond and JetBrains Mono are licensed for redistribution in the
  Android APK (SIL OFL / Apache 2.0). Inter is already broadly used and
  similarly licensed.
- Material You / dynamic color is intentionally NOT adopted for refit surfaces;
  Quiet Almanac is a fixed palette.
- The flag default flip from `false` to `true` is a separate, post-Phase-4
  decision — not part of this spec.
- Demo Day is 2026-05-22; phases land before that date for screens NOT named
  "bubble".
- The phase-11-block-7 primitives (`AgentVoiceMark`, `ClusterActionRow`,
  `CapsulePalette`) survive into the new language. Phase 11 Block 8
  (`ClusterSuggestionCard`) consumes them per the existing spec 002 plan.

## Dependencies

- **DEP-001 (RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — referred out to spec 016)** —
  IntentEnvelope schema migration to adopt the LD-002 intent set ("drop
  in-orbit + archive, add for-someone") is authored as its own spec:
  **`016-intent-set-migration`**. It is a data-layer migration (Room
  schema version bump, `IntentEnvelope` enum change, migration SQL with
  `intentHistoryJson` rewrite for existing rows) with its own rollback
  story, contracts, and risk profile. It cross-cuts capture flow, diary
  mini-intent display, Salesforce `Alpha_User__c`, design canvas
  reference docs, founder kit personas, and `product-dna.md`. Spec 016
  may be drafted in parallel; it does **not** gate spec 015 Phases 0–3.
  It **must** merge before spec 015 Phase 4 (capture sheet) lands.
- **DEP-002 (RESOLVED 2026-04-29)** — User confirmed the D4 amendment
  target is `specs/010-visual-polish-pass/spec.md` (immediately after
  the existing D4 entry, currently at line 171). Spec 010 never had a
  `tasks.md` — `spec.md` was always the only file. The amendment
  wording is locked; see [tasks.md](tasks.md) T015-018 for the exact
  block to insert.
- **DEP-003 (RESOLVED 2026-04-29 — gated)** — Phase 11 Block 7 (PR #4)
  must be merged into `main` before Phase 0 commit 1 can start, because
  Phase 0 commit 1 extends `Colors.kt` (introduced in PR #4) and Phase 0
  commit 3 modifies `AgentVoiceMark.kt` (also PR #4). Required merge
  order: **PR #3 → PR #4 → rebase `015-visual-refit` onto fresh main →
  user green-lights Phase 0 commit 1**. Non-negotiable.

## Out of Scope (Explicit)

- Duplicate capture detection and `Already saved` product behavior; this lands
  in spec 017 (`017-capture-feedback-actions`) because it changes repository,
  IPC, and user action semantics.
- Slate / philosophy page in app (belongs to `orbitassistant.com`).
- Launch video in app (press kit / website).
- IntentEnvelope schema migration (DEP-001).
- Material You / dynamic color adoption.
- Any change under `app/src/main/java/com/capsule/app/bubble/`.
- Any schema migration for duplicate keys, notes, or contact refs.
- Cloud LLM gateway changes (spec 014).
- Cluster engine / detector behavior (spec 002 territory).

## Constitutional Notes

- **Principle III (Intent Before Artifact)**: User-facing wording becomes
  "reclassify adds a layer, latest visible" (LD-003). The data layer's
  append-only `intentHistoryJson` semantics are unchanged. Per spec 002
  data-model, a reclassify still appends an audit entry; the refit only
  renames how that semantics is described to the user.
- **Principle X (Sovereign Cloud Storage)** and **Principle IX
  (User-Sovereign Cloud LLM)**: Settings danger-row wording (FR-015-011)
  must not promise behavior that depends on third-party SLAs Orbit cannot
  enforce. "Forget everything" copy explicitly bounds Orbit's commitment to
  Orbit-controlled storage and on-device caches.
- All other 14 principles are untouched by this presentation-only refit.
