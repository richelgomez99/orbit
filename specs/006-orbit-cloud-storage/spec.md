# Orbit Cloud Storage (v1.1)

**Legacy status (2026-05-13)**: Archived input for the roadmap rebaseline. This is not the active `006` Speckit source anymore. During `docs/product-truth-reset`, preserve this draft under an archive/legacy path and reuse slot `006` for `006-approval-action-runtime`; carry storage, sync, export, deletion, and tenant-isolation ideas forward into `008-cloud-controls-storage-budgeting`.

**Status**: DRAFT — targets v1.1
**Depends on**: spec 002 complete (EnvelopeStorageBackend abstraction from tasks 002/T025c–T025d)
**Governing document**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — implements Principle X Model A, Principles XI and XII
**Created**: 2026-04-17
**Last amended**: 2026-04-20 (renamed from BYOC Cloud Storage to Orbit Cloud Storage under constitution v3.0.0; BYOC moved to spec 009)

---

## Summary

Orbit Cloud Storage is the default cloud tier for Orbit users who opt into
cloud features. It is an Orbit-operated managed PostgreSQL service with a
strict structural-guarantee boundary: each user gets a dedicated schema
(`orbit_<user_id>`), a dedicated database role, and a per-user Data
Encryption Key (DEK) wrapped by a KMS-managed Key Encryption Key. Orbit
operates the infrastructure; the user still owns the data, holds the
right to export or delete at any moment, and retains provenance through a
local-only audit log and consent ledger.

This spec replaces the former v1.2 BYOC-first design. BYOC (Bring Your
Own Cloud) is still supported — it is now spec 009 targeting v1.3 for
power users who want full sovereignty over the cloud tier. For everyone
else, Orbit Cloud is the default opt-in path to multi-device sync, the
full knowledge graph, vector retrieval, and the Orbit agent's long-term
memory.

The core commitment encoded by Principle X Model A: **structural
guarantees (per-tenant schema, per-user DEK, locally held consent ledger,
GDPR-compliant export/delete, no cross-tenant derivatives) make managed
multi-tenancy constitutionally permissible.** Migration to BYOC (spec
009) is lossless by construction — the schemas are identical.

## User Stories

### US-006-001 — One-tap cloud onboarding (Priority: P1)

As a user who finishes v1 onboarding, I see an optional "Enable Orbit
Cloud" card in Settings that explains what enabling means in plain
language. Tapping "Enable" signs me in with my Orbit account, provisions
my tenant schema, uploads my device's public key, and flips cloud-backed
features on with zero further configuration.

**Acceptance**:

1. Settings → Cloud Storage shows Orbit Cloud as the default option with
   an "Advanced → Use my own database" entry point to BYOC (spec 009).
2. Enabling Orbit Cloud triggers account sign-in (Orbit identity) and,
   on first enable, provisions an `orbit_<user_id>` schema and role
   server-side within 30 seconds.
3. The device uploads its public key; the server wraps a newly generated
   DEK with the user's KMS KEK; the wrapped DEK is stored server-side,
   the plaintext DEK is pulled on-device only at use.
4. Enable surfaces a clear consent card listing exactly what will sync,
   what will not (audit log, consent ledger, `local_only` facts), and
   where the data is hosted (region).

### US-006-002 — Opt-in per data category (Priority: P1)

As a user with Orbit Cloud enabled, I toggle individual data categories
independently. The audit log and consent ledger are never syncable.

**Acceptance**:

1. Independent toggles: envelopes, embeddings, knowledge graph, profile
   facts, continuation results, agent memory, plans, skill registry.
   Default: envelopes + embeddings + KG + profile facts ON (required for
   spec 004 Ask Orbit); agent memory + plans + skill registry ON when
   spec 008 Agent is enabled.
2. No toggle for `AUDIT_LOG` or `CONSENT_LEDGER`. The UI explicitly
   notes they stay on-device forever.
3. Toggling a category ON triggers a one-time backfill continuation;
   toggling OFF stops future sync (not retroactive delete).
4. Profile facts and KG nodes/edges tagged `local_only` are never
   uploaded regardless of toggle state (enforced by Principle XI in
   `:agent`).

### US-006-003 — Local is authoritative (Priority: P1)

As a user whose cloud connection drops, Orbit keeps working with zero
functional loss.

**Acceptance**:

1. Cloud sync failures do not block local writes. Last-N-days diary
   projection stays on-device for offline use.
2. Cloud unreachable for > 24 hours surfaces a non-blocking banner in
   Settings.
3. Disabling Orbit Cloud removes every cloud-path code branch from
   runtime; subsequent sessions behave exactly like a local-only install.

### US-006-004 — Data export and deletion user-initiated (Priority: P1)

As a user who wants to see, export, or delete my cloud data, I can do so
without opening a support ticket.

**Acceptance**:

1. Settings → Cloud Storage → "Export my data" triggers a GDPR-grade
   export job that produces a ZIP containing JSON for every row in my
   tenant schema; delivery via signed download link within 72 hours.
2. Settings → Cloud Storage → "Delete all my cloud data" prompts for
   explicit confirmation, then fires a `DELETE /tenant` request that
   drops `orbit_<user_id>` schema, revokes the role, and destroys the
   wrapped DEK in KMS within 72 hours.
3. Deletion is confirmed by a local audit log entry with the export
   receipt ID, and the in-app receipt is surfaced when the user opens
   Cloud Storage again.
4. Orbit publishes a quarterly transparency report listing aggregate
   (non-user-identifying) deletion, export, and consent-revocation
   counts.

### US-006-005 — Multi-device sync as a first-class feature (Priority: P1)

As a user with Orbit Cloud on two devices, my envelopes, KG, agent
memory, and profile appear on both devices and stay in sync.

**Acceptance**:

1. A new envelope sealed on device A appears on device B within 30
   seconds when B has network.
2. Conflict resolution: last-writer-wins on non-content fields; content
   is append-only per Principle III.
3. Audit logs and consent ledgers do NOT merge — each device retains its
   own local history.
4. Each device is registered in a `device_registry` table tied to the
   Orbit account; the user can revoke a device from any other device.

### US-006-006 — Migrate to BYOC at any time (Priority: P2)

As a user who later decides they want full sovereignty, I can export my
Orbit Cloud tenant and import it into a BYOC Postgres (spec 009) without
feature loss.

**Acceptance**:

1. Settings → Cloud Storage → "Move to BYOC" initiates a schema-
   identical transfer from Orbit Cloud to the user's configured BYOC
   instance.
2. After successful transfer, Orbit Cloud tenant is placed in read-only
   mode pending confirmation to purge.
3. Confirmed purge deletes the Orbit Cloud tenant within 72 hours and
   records the event in the local audit log.

## Non-Goals (v1.1)

- No cross-tenant analytics, training data, or derivatives (Principle
  X Model A condition #3, enforced at the database role level —
  tenants literally cannot see each other).
- No raw screenshot bytes by default. Thumbnails, OCR, and transcripts
  only; originals stay on device unless the user explicitly uploads.
- No peer-to-peer device sync.
- No offline-first conflict resolution beyond last-writer-wins on
  non-content fields.
- No Firestore or non-Postgres backend.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Storage and tenancy

- **FR-006-001**: System MUST expose an `OrbitCloudBackend` implementation
  of `EnvelopeStorageBackend` (002 T025c) that writes to local Room first
  and enqueues an asynchronous cloud mirror job originating from the
  `:net` process.
- **FR-006-002**: System MUST provision exactly one schema per user named
  `orbit_<user_id>` server-side on enable, with a dedicated database
  role that has privileges restricted to that schema.
- **FR-006-003**: System MUST prohibit any server-side query that joins
  across tenant schemas. The database role enforcement is the structural
  guarantee.
- **FR-006-004**: System MUST version the schema and run migrations
  server-side in a way that preserves tenant isolation (one schema
  migrated at a time, not across tenants in a shared table).

### Encryption

- **FR-006-005**: System MUST generate a per-user DEK on enable, wrap
  it with a KMS-managed KEK, and store only the wrapped blob
  server-side.
- **FR-006-006**: Columns containing envelope bodies, media references,
  transcripts, and any profile fact tagged above `public_to_orbit`
  MUST be stored ciphertext encrypted with the user's DEK.
- **FR-006-007**: Metadata columns used for indexing (timestamps,
  tenant id, envelope id, KG edge types, bi-temporal bounds) MAY be
  stored plaintext to support server-side queries; content columns
  MUST NOT be.
- **FR-006-008**: Device key material for decrypting DEK-wrapped
  ciphertext MUST live only on-device in Android Keystore.

### Consent and provenance

- **FR-006-009**: System MUST NEVER sync the audit log to cloud.
- **FR-006-010**: System MUST NEVER sync the consent ledger to cloud.
- **FR-006-011**: System MUST enforce Principle XI on every cloud
  write — prompts and payloads assembled in `:agent` are filtered for
  `local_only` facts, fresh consent, sensitivity, and necessity before
  crossing into `:net`.
- **FR-006-012**: System MUST enforce Principle XII on every cloud
  write — derived facts without an `episode_id` reference are
  rejected at write time.
- **FR-006-013**: System MUST audit-log every cloud read, every cloud
  write, every failed attempt, and every schema migration, keeping
  the audit log on-device forever.

### Lifecycle and rights

- **FR-006-014**: System MUST provide a GDPR-grade export job producing
  a ZIP of every row in the tenant schema, deliverable within 72 hours
  of request, with a signed download link.
- **FR-006-015**: System MUST provide a full-tenant deletion flow that
  drops `orbit_<user_id>`, revokes the role, destroys the wrapped DEK
  in KMS, and completes within 72 hours with a local audit confirmation.
- **FR-006-016**: System MUST surface per-device revocation so a user
  can sign out a lost device from any other device.
- **FR-006-017**: Orbit MUST publish a quarterly transparency report
  listing aggregate (non-identifying) counts of deletions, exports,
  and consent revocations.

### Migration to BYOC

- **FR-006-018**: System MUST provide a lossless Tier 1 → Tier 2
  migration path. The schemas match by construction; the migration
  rewraps the DEK for the target environment.
- **FR-006-019**: After successful BYOC transfer confirmation, the
  Orbit Cloud tenant MUST be deleted within 72 hours per FR-006-015.

### Bi-temporal traversal (no AGE)

Multi-hop graph traversal uses recursive CTEs over `kg_edges` with
`valid_from`/`valid_to`/`invalidated_at` as filter predicates. Apache
AGE is intentionally not used in v1.1 — it adds operational complexity
without enough payoff for the traversal patterns Orbit cares about.
Example pattern appendix to be maintained alongside this spec.

## Open Questions

- Hosting choice: Neon managed Postgres (lower ops) vs self-hosted on
  Hetzner (lower cost, higher ops). Leaning Neon for launch, reserving
  Hetzner as a cost-cut lever.
- Region placement: launch US-only or offer region pick on enable?
  Leaning US + EU at launch; add regions as demand warrants.
- Do we expose the transparency report from within Settings, or only on
  the Orbit website? Leaning both (in-app link + web).
