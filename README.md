# Orbit

**A local-first, cloud-augmented personal memory layer for Android.**

> Think OpenClaw, but on the device that's with you all day — and the OS is the sandbox.

Orbit catches what you screenshot, copy, and save across every app on your phone, turns those moments into structured intent envelopes, and helps you understand, retrieve, and act on them later — a daily diary of what your attention was actually on, calendar events extracted from flight confirmations, to-dos surfaced from screenshots, and eventually natural-language answers across everything you've ever saved.

Orbit is no longer framed as local-only. The phone remains the capture surface and local source of truth, while cloud infrastructure can support heavier LLM, retrieval, storage, observability, and agent work behind explicit product controls, auditability, and a permanent local-mode escape hatch.

## Status

Building in public as 1 of 500 builders in **[Canopy by Founders, Inc.](https://f.inc/canopy)** — a 5-week incubator for "obsessed builders." Demo Day: **May 22, 2026**.

| **Capture overlay** (the always-on bubble) | ✅ Shipped | Apr 18 |
| **Daily diary** (v1 target) | 🔨 Building | Target: May 22 |
| **Orbit Actions** (v1.1) — calendar + to-do extraction | 📋 Spec'd | Post-v1 |
| **Capture understanding** — source identity, evidence bundles, summaries | 📋 Rebaselining | Post-v1 |
| **Retrieval + Ask** — natural-language Q&A with citations | 📋 Rebaselining | Post-v1 |
| **Cloud controls + memory/KG/agent layers** | 📋 Rebaselining | Post-v1 |

## Why Android, why now

On **April 2, 2026**, Google previewed [**Gemini Nano 4**](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2026/04/AI-Core-Developer-Preview.html) in the AICore Developer Preview — the next generation of on-device AI for Android.

- **4× faster** than the previous Nano
- **60% less battery** per inference
- **Multimodal**: text, image, audio
- **140+ languages**
- Two variants: Nano 4 **Fast** (speed) and Nano 4 **Full** (reasoning)
- Forward-compatible: code written today ships the moment flagship devices get the model later in 2026

Orbit is being built against that preview. This isn't a bet on future AI — it's a bet on AI developers can touch right now, that consumers will have on their phones in months.

## The problem

Your phone is full of screenshots, copied text, recipes, articles, flight confirmations, voice notes, and group-chat snippets you saved because they mattered in the moment. They go nowhere. Your phone forgets them. You forget you ever cared.

We've normalized building products that turn your attention into someone else's data and then give you nothing back in return. Orbit is the inverse: your attention compounds for *you*, with local capture as the root of trust and cloud capabilities used only where they make the memory layer more capable, traceable, and useful on your terms.

## The five-week roadmap

| Version | What ships | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **v1** | Floating capture bubble · daily diary · intent classification · soft-delete & trash · URL-hash deduplication | **May 22, 2026** (Demo Day) |
| **v1.1** | Orbit Actions — extract calendar events from confirmations, build to-dos from screenshots | Post-v1 |
| **v1.2** | Capture understanding + Retrieval/Ask — source-aware summaries, evidence, and cited answers | Post-v1 |
| **v1.3** | Cloud controls, storage, memory candidates, and KG backend proof of concept | Post-v1 |
| **v1.4+** | Agent coordinator, manual compose, and resolution semantics | Long-term |

## Architecture at a glance

**Core principles** (full list in [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](./.specify/memory/constitution.md)):

1. Local-first supremacy — source of truth lives on-device, in SQLCipher; cloud augments capability, not authority
2. Privilege separation by design — split code boundaries for capture, ML, network, UI, with network clients restricted to `com.orbit.app.net.*`
3. Intent before artifact — every save starts with *why*, not *what*
4. Under-deliver on noise — Orbit stays quiet by default
5. Cloud LLM routing is allowed through the audited `:net`/gateway path, with local-mode fallback
6. Orbit Cloud is the default managed tier once enabled; BYOK/BYOC remain power-user escape hatches, not the starting promise
7. …and four more (audit-log transparency, accumulated corpus lock-in, continuations grow captures, cross-app intent graph)

**Stack:**

- **Language:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
- **On-device AI:** Gemini Nano 4 (via AICore, from April preview) · ML Kit for OCR
- **Cloud AI + observability:** Supabase Postgres + pgvector, Vercel Edge Function LLM gateway, no-content traces/evals where enabled
- **Storage:** Room + SQLCipher, Android Keystore for key wrapping
- **Service model:** Foreground service with `specialUse` type for the overlay, WorkManager for retention + hydration workers
- **IPC / boundaries:** Android services and Binder/AIDL where available; network code remains isolated behind `com.orbit.app.net.*`

## Who I'm looking to talk to

- **Android power users** who are tired of their phone being a one-way data pipeline for everyone but them
- Builders working on **on-device AI**, **mobile-first agents**, or **privacy-respecting consumer products**
- Anyone who's shipped a **fully privacy-respecting consumer product** (Signal, ProtonMail, Apple Health, Pixel on-device features, Arc) and figured out how to learn from users *without* surveilling them — I want to compare notes on the feedback-loop problem
- Potential **co-founders** who want to build this with me past Demo Day

## Built by

[**Richel Gomez**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richelgomez) — Implementation & Solutions Engineer, 1st place NYC AI Agents Hackathon, Overclock Accelerator Cohort 5, Canopy by Founders, Inc. cohort member.

I had never built an Android app before Wednesday, April 15, 2026. Three days later, the capture overlay was shipped. This is what coding agents enable now — and what five weeks of heads-down focus at Founders, Inc. is about to produce.

All rights reserved, for now. License decision will be made at/after Demo Day (May 22, 2026) once the v1 scope is shipped and the local-first/cloud-augmented architecture is stable.
