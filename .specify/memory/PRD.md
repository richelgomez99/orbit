# Orbit v1 Product Requirements: Intent Envelope and Diary

**Product**: Orbit — local-first personal memory layer for mobile
**Version**: 1.0 (Phase 1)
**Feature Branch**: `002-intent-envelope-and-diary`
**Created**: 2026-04-16
**Status**: Draft
**Governing documents**:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — the twelve principles.
- `.specify/memory/design.md` — visual architecture (typography, color,
  motion, every surface). All "UI" references in this PRD defer to it.

> **Relationship to spec 001:** This PRD supersedes the v0 functional scope in
> `specs/001-core-capture-overlay/spec.md`. The bubble overlay service,
> clipboard focus state machine, and bubble drag/edge-snap behavior from 001
> are KEPT AS-IS as foundational primitives. This PRD REPLACES 001's "Capture
> Sheet + Save/Discard + Logcat" flow with the Intent Envelope and Diary
> model. The rename from "Orbit" to "Orbit" is separate work tracked at the
> repository root.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 — Capture With Intent (Priority: P1)

As a user who just copied a URL, phrase, or image reference from somewhere on
my phone, I tap the floating Orbit bubble (or it observes silently, depending
on the capture path). Within two seconds I see a small chip row offering four
intent options — *Want it*, *Reference*, *For someone*, *Interesting* — so I
can tell Orbit why I saved this. I tap one chip and the capture is filed. If
I do nothing within the two seconds, the chip row disappears and the capture
is filed under *Ambiguous*, to be sorted later from the Diary. If the capture
is unambiguous (e.g., a single URL from a shopping app where I already have
two similar saves), Orbit silently wraps it with a confident intent and never
shows me a chip row at all.

**Why this priority**: The intent question — *why did I save this?* — is what
separates Orbit from a screenshot folder. Without intent, every other feature
is rebuilding the graveyard. With intent, every capture becomes a retrievable
memory.

**Independent Test**: Copy a URL in Chrome, tap the bubble, confirm the
four-chip row appears within 2s of tap, tap *Want it*, and verify (via the
Diary in Story 2) that the envelope appears under *Want it*.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has copied text to the clipboard, **When** the user
   taps the floating bubble, **Then** within 2 seconds a chip row appears
   with exactly four intent options (*Want it*, *Reference*, *For someone*,
   *Interesting*) over a short preview of the captured content.
2. **Given** the chip row is visible, **When** the user taps one of the four
   chips, **Then** the chip row dismisses, the envelope is sealed with the
   chosen intent, and a brief confirmation toast appears.
3. **Given** the chip row is visible, **When** the user does nothing for 2
   seconds, **Then** the chip row auto-dismisses and the envelope is sealed
   with intent *Ambiguous*.
4. **Given** the user has copied a URL from a shopping app where the user
   has recently saved similar URLs with the same intent, **When** the user
   taps the bubble, **Then** no chip row appears, the envelope is silently
   sealed with the predicted intent, and only a brief confirmation toast
   is shown.
5. **Given** the user has just captured an envelope, **When** the user taps
   the confirmation toast within 10 seconds, **Then** the envelope is
   discarded before it reaches the Diary.

---

### User Story 2 — Daily Diary (Priority: P1)

As a user who has been capturing throughout the day, I open the Orbit app and
land directly on today's page of the Diary. At the top is a short paragraph
that describes in plain language what I captured today — not a list, but a
summary, like *"You spent the morning in work email, captured two articles on
caching from Reddit around 2pm, and saved three restaurants from Instagram
tonight."* Below the paragraph are my captures for the day, grouped into
threads where Orbit recognizes related items, each card showing which app the
capture came from, my activity state (still, walking, in vehicle), and the
time. I can swipe left to see yesterday, swipe right to go forward. I never
see a generic "list of screenshots." I see *my day*.

**Why this priority**: The Diary is the return surface. Without it, captures
disappear the moment they happen, and Orbit fails its core promise that
captures resurface when actionable. The Diary is the daily moment a user
experiences the product.

**Independent Test**: After capturing 5+ items across different apps and
times on the same day, open Orbit. Confirm today's page loads within 1
second, the day-header paragraph references at least 3 of the captured
items, and at least one thread groups related captures together.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has captured at least one envelope today, **When** the
   user opens the Orbit app, **Then** the Diary opens to today's page with
   a day-header paragraph and the day's envelopes grouped by thread below.
2. **Given** the Diary is showing today, **When** the user swipes horizontally,
   **Then** the previous or next day's page loads within 500ms with its own
   day-header paragraph.
3. **Given** the user is viewing a day's page with multiple envelopes, **When**
   the user looks at an envelope card, **Then** the card shows the originating
   app name, the activity state at capture, and the capture time in a small
   context label.
4. **Given** two envelopes were captured within 30 minutes of each other from
   the same app and share visible content similarity, **When** the user views
   the Diary, **Then** they appear grouped under a single thread card.
5. **Given** a day had no captures, **When** the user swipes to that day,
   **Then** the page shows an empty-day message rather than a blank screen.

---

### User Story 3 — URL Continuation (Priority: P1)

As a user who captured a link on the go — say, an article URL from Reddit
while walking — I open the Diary that evening. The envelope for that URL
already shows the article's title, a two-sentence summary, and the source
domain. I did not do any of this work; Orbit fetched the page in the
background on my home wifi, extracted the readable article, and summarized
it with on-device AI, all while I went about my day.

**Why this priority**: Continuations are what turn captures from archived
bookmarks into usable memory. A raw URL in a list is noise; a URL with a
summary I can scan in 3 seconds is something I actually use. Without
continuations, the Diary becomes another digital graveyard.

**Independent Test**: Capture a URL on cellular, put the device on charger
at home wifi, wait up to 2 minutes, open the Diary. Confirm the envelope
shows the article title, domain, and a 2-3 sentence summary.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user captures an envelope containing a URL, **When** the
   device later reaches a charger+wifi state, **Then** the envelope is
   enriched with the URL's title, source domain, excerpt, and a 2-3
   sentence summary, visible on the envelope's Diary card.
2. **Given** a URL fetch fails (network error, 404, non-HTML content),
   **When** the user views the envelope in the Diary, **Then** the card
   shows the raw URL with an "Enrichment unavailable" indicator and the
   reason.
3. **Given** an envelope is a screenshot containing a visible URL, **When**
   the device reaches a charger+wifi state, **Then** the URL is extracted
   from the image and the same enrichment flow runs, with the result
   attached to the screenshot envelope.
4. **Given** an envelope's URL is at a non-HTTPS address, **When** the
   continuation system evaluates it, **Then** no network fetch is
   performed and the envelope shows "Enrichment unavailable: non-secure URL".

---

### User Story 4 — Ambient Screenshot Capture (Priority: P2)

As a user who takes a lot of screenshots throughout the day, I do not want
to be interrupted every time I screenshot. Orbit observes my screenshots
folder silently and creates an ambiguous envelope for each one. When I open
the Diary that evening, my screenshots are already there, ready for me to
assign intent with a tap if I want to.

**Why this priority**: Screenshots are the largest source of graveyard
buildup on Android, and interrupting a user mid-screenshot is hostile.
Ambient observation makes the graveyard-prevention happen automatically.
Deferred to P2 because clipboard capture alone delivers a working product;
screenshots expand coverage.

**Independent Test**: Take 3 screenshots using the device screenshot shortcut.
Do not open Orbit. Open Orbit later and confirm 3 new *Ambiguous* envelopes
exist for today, each with the screenshot preview, app-of-origin, and
capture time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Orbit service is running, **When** the user takes a
   screenshot via the device shortcut, **Then** within 5 seconds an
   envelope is created with intent *Ambiguous* and the screenshot as its
   content. The user sees no prompt.
2. **Given** an ambiguous screenshot envelope exists, **When** the user
   taps the envelope card in the Diary, **Then** an intent chip row is
   presented so the user can assign intent retroactively.
3. **Given** the user screenshots an image with no foreground-app context
   (e.g., lock screen), **When** the envelope is created, **Then** the
   context label reads "Unknown source" rather than misattributing.

---

### User Story 5 — Contextual Envelope Labels (Priority: P2)

As a user scanning my Diary a week later, I see on each envelope card a
small context label: "from Instagram · still · 11:47pm" or "from Chrome ·
walking · 2:14pm Tuesday." These three pieces of context — source app,
activity state, time — tell me the story of *when in my life* I saved this,
which is often enough to remember *why* I saved it without reading the
envelope itself.

**Why this priority**: Context labels turn the Diary from a list of items
into a readable narrative of the user's captured week. Without them, the
Diary is still useful (Story 2) but much less memorable. P2 because the
Diary works without them; they compound the value.

**Independent Test**: Capture one envelope while in Instagram while still,
and one envelope while in Chrome while walking. Confirm the Diary cards
show correct app + activity + time for each.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user captures an envelope while using a known app, **When**
   the user later views the envelope in the Diary, **Then** the card shows
   the categorized app name (e.g., "Instagram") in the context label.
2. **Given** the user captures an envelope while in a recognized activity
   state (still, walking, running, in vehicle), **When** the user views
   the envelope in the Diary, **Then** the card shows the activity state
   in the context label.
3. **Given** the user has not granted usage-stats or activity-recognition
   permissions, **When** the user views envelopes in the Diary, **Then**
   the context labels show only the capture time, and the app gracefully
   degrades without errors.

---

### User Story 6 — Audit Log (Priority: P2)

As a user who was told Orbit is local-first and does not send my data
anywhere, I want to verify that claim for myself. I open Settings → *What
Orbit did today* and see a human-readable log: every envelope created,
every on-device AI inference run, every public URL fetched (and nothing
else). The log is local-only, readable, timestamped, and plain.

**Why this priority**: Trust is not marketing; trust is auditable. A user
who cannot verify the local-first claim has no reason to believe it. P2
because the app is functional without it, but the trust moat is weakened.

**Independent Test**: Use the app for an hour, then open *What Orbit did
today*. Confirm the count of log entries matches the actions taken, and
that no network fetches appear except for URL hydrations the user knows
about.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has used the app today, **When** the user opens
   *What Orbit did today*, **Then** a chronological list appears showing
   every envelope created, every AI summary generated, every URL fetched,
   in plain language with timestamps.
2. **Given** the user taps a log entry, **When** the expanded view shows,
   **Then** it describes in plain English what that action did and what
   data was involved — no opaque technical codes.
3. **Given** a user-content transmission were to ever occur, **When** the
   user opens the audit log, **Then** it would be visible and flagged.
   (This scenario must never trigger in a shipped build; it exists as a
   contract for the log's completeness.)

---

### User Story 7 — Onboarding With Informed Consent (Priority: P3)

As a new user installing Orbit for the first time, I am walked through four
permission requests — overlay, notifications, usage access, activity
recognition — each with a plain-language explanation of what Orbit uses it
for and what I lose if I decline. Declining any optional permission does
not block the app; it gracefully degrades. I reach a working state in under
5 minutes.

**Why this priority**: Polish. The app technically works without refined
onboarding, but first-impression trust is earned here. P3 because MVP can
ship with a functional-but-rough onboarding.

**Independent Test**: Fresh install on a test device. Time the onboarding.
Decline usage-access permission and confirm the app still captures and
shows the Diary, just with less context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh install, **When** the user opens the app, **Then** the
   onboarding flow presents each of the four permissions in sequence with
   a one-sentence plain-language purpose statement.
2. **Given** the user declines usage-access or activity-recognition, **When**
   onboarding completes, **Then** the app still launches, captures still
   work, and an unobtrusive banner in Settings offers to re-request the
   declined permissions later.
3. **Given** the user declines the overlay or notifications permission,
   **When** onboarding continues, **Then** the user is informed that these
   two are required for the core capture loop and given a single chance to
   re-request them, before being routed to a "reduced capability" mode.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Offline capture, extended offline device**: A capture occurs while the
  device is offline and stays offline for days. The envelope is created and
  stored locally; URL continuations sit in a queue indefinitely and execute
  when network and charger-wifi conditions are met. The envelope never
  blocks on the network.
- **Gemini Nano unavailable**: The envelope is still created and persisted
  with raw content; AI-dependent features (summary, day-header paragraph)
  show a fallback message and do not block the Diary from rendering.
- **Non-HTTPS redirect**: A captured URL redirects to a non-HTTPS address.
  The continuation refuses to follow the redirect and marks enrichment
  unavailable (per FR-015).
- **Out of local storage**: Orbit surfaces a persistent banner in the Diary
  explaining the issue and offers a one-tap path to the OS storage settings.
  New captures pause until space is reclaimed; no silent capture loss.
- **Permission revoked post-onboarding**: The user revokes usage access
  while the service is running. The service detects the revocation on the
  next capture, gracefully degrades context labels, and surfaces a Settings
  banner without crashing.
- **Rapid captures**: Two captures occur within 100ms of each other (e.g.,
  rapid clipboard changes). Each is treated as a distinct envelope unless
  content is byte-identical, in which case the second is deduplicated.
- **Non-English locale**: Nano-generated text uses the system locale if
  supported; otherwise English. The day-header and summaries indicate
  their generation language.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST capture user intent within 2 seconds of a save
  event by presenting a chip row with four options: *Want it*, *Reference*,
  *For someone*, *Interesting*.
- **FR-002**: System MUST seal every capture into an **IntentEnvelope**
  that includes the captured content, the user's chosen (or inferred)
  intent, and context captured at the moment of save.
- **FR-003**: System MUST auto-dismiss the intent chip row after 2 seconds
  of user inactivity, sealing the envelope with intent *Ambiguous*.
- **FR-004**: System MUST, for captures that meet a high-confidence
  predicate, silently seal the envelope with a predicted intent and show
  only a brief confirmation — never a chip row.
- **FR-005**: System MUST attach to every envelope: the timestamp of
  capture, the categorized originating app (from the project's app-
  category dictionary), and the user's device activity state.
- **FR-006**: System MUST observe the device screenshots folder and create
  an envelope for each new screenshot, without user prompt, with intent
  *Ambiguous*.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow the user to reassign intent on any
  *Ambiguous* envelope from the Diary by tapping the envelope card.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a 10-second undo window on every capture,
  surfaced via a confirmation toast, after which the envelope is sealed.
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all envelopes in encrypted local storage
  that is not accessible to other apps on the device.
- **FR-010**: System MUST present a Daily Diary as the primary app surface,
  one day per horizontally swipeable page, showing all envelopes captured
  on that day grouped into threads of related captures.
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate a plain-language day-header paragraph
  for each day's Diary page, summarizing the day's captures using on-
  device AI only.
- **FR-012**: System MUST display on every envelope card in the Diary a
  context label showing the categorized originating app, the activity
  state at capture, and the capture time.
- **FR-013**: System MUST, for envelopes containing or referring to a
  public HTTPS URL, enrich the envelope in the background with the URL's
  title, domain, excerpt, and a 2-3 sentence summary.
- **FR-014**: System MUST extract URLs from screenshot envelopes via on-
  device text recognition and trigger the same URL enrichment flow.
- **FR-015**: System MUST refuse to fetch non-HTTPS URLs and MUST strip
  cookies, referer headers, and any user-identifying information from
  every outbound network request.
- **FR-016**: System MUST NEVER transmit captured content, state signals,
  or any derived inferences (summaries, tags, embeddings) to remote
  servers. The only permitted outbound network calls are fetches of
  public URLs the user has explicitly captured.
- **FR-017**: System MUST structurally separate processes with network
  access from processes with access to user content, such that a single
  process cannot both read the corpus and reach the network.
- **FR-018**: System MUST record an audit log entry, visible to the user
  in plain language, for every envelope creation, every on-device AI
  inference, and every outbound network fetch.
- **FR-019**: System MUST request exactly four permissions during
  onboarding — overlay, notifications, usage access, activity recognition
  — each with a plain-language justification.
- **FR-020**: System MUST gracefully degrade if usage access or activity
  recognition are declined: captures still work, the Diary still renders,
  and context labels show only the information the user has permitted.
- **FR-021**: System MUST treat declining the overlay or notifications
  permission as blocking for the core capture loop, offer one re-request,
  and route to a read-only reduced mode thereafter.
- **FR-022**: System MUST allow the user to archive or delete any envelope
  from the Diary at any time, with a confirmation step, and reflect the
  removal in the audit log.
- **FR-023**: System MUST record intent assignments as append-only —
  intent can be superseded but not rewritten, and every supersession
  creates an audit log entry.
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide a one-tap export of all envelopes and
  their content in an open, human-readable format, on user request.
- **FR-025**: System MUST preserve all existing spec 001 capabilities —
  the overlay bubble service, clipboard focus state machine, bubble drag
  and edge-snap, service survival guarantees, and battery-optimization
  guidance — without regression.

### Key Entities

- **IntentEnvelope**: The sealed atomic unit of an Orbit save. Contains
  the captured content (text, image, or both), the intent label, the
  context snapshot (time, app, activity), the creation timestamp, a
  supersession chain of intent changes, and a link to any continuations.
- **Continuation**: A deferred background operation attached to an
  envelope, such as URL hydration. Has a type, a run condition
  (charger+wifi, device idle), a status
  (pending/running/succeeded/failed), and a result.
- **ContinuationResult**: The output of a successful continuation — for
  URL hydration, this is the title, domain, excerpt, and summary. Stored
  separately from the envelope so an envelope can have zero, one, or many
  enrichments over time.
- **AuditLogEntry**: A user-readable record of a system action. Has a
  timestamp, an action type (envelope_created, inference_run,
  network_fetch, envelope_archived, intent_superseded), a plain-language
  description, and the envelope (if any) it relates to.
- **DayPage**: The Diary's rendering unit for a single calendar day. Has
  a generated header paragraph, an ordered list of threads, and a
  fallback state for empty days.
- **Thread**: A group of envelopes on the same day that share an app, a
  topic, or near-simultaneous capture time, rendered as a single card in
  the Diary with expansion into individual envelopes.

---

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user can go from deciding to save something to having it
  filed in Orbit in under 3 seconds.
- **SC-002**: At least 60% of captures proceed silently (no chip row
  shown) as high-confidence silent-wraps within 14 days of regular use.
- **SC-003**: At least 90% of URL-containing envelopes have a summary
  visible on their Diary card the next time the user opens the Diary
  (assuming at least one charger+wifi window elapsed).
- **SC-004**: The Diary loads today's page in under 1 second and scrolls
  horizontally between days in under 500ms, for users with up to 1,000
  envelopes.
- **SC-005**: Users rate the day-header paragraph as accurately reflecting
  their day's captures in at least 85% of random samples.
- **SC-006**: Zero user-content transmissions occur outside of explicitly
  user-captured public-URL hydrations — verifiable by the audit log.
- **SC-007**: A first-time user experiences the full capture → diary
  return loop within 5 minutes of first opening the app.
- **SC-008**: Users locate a specific past capture in the Diary in under
  30 seconds at least 90% of the time.
- **SC-009**: In a 14-day dogfood of the primary user, captures average
  at least 5 per day and Diary opens average at least 3 per week, with
  no single day of zero opens.
- **SC-010**: A user who declines usage-access and activity-recognition
  still experiences every core feature (capture, diary, URL enrichment)
  with only context labels degraded.
- **SC-011**: The app retains at least 80% of 14-day-active users through
  day 28, measured via local-only engagement counters.

---

## Assumptions

- The target device runs Android 13 (API 33) or higher.
- Gemini Nano is available on the target device via AICore; devices
  without Nano experience a thinner Diary (no day-header paragraphs, no
  URL summaries) but every other feature works.
- The user grants overlay and notifications permissions during onboarding.
  Declining either routes to a reduced read-only mode.
- The user captures via clipboard (bubble tap) and/or screenshots in v1.
  Share-sheet and voice capture are deferred to Phase 2.
- All Phase 1 content classification, summarization, and topic tagging
  runs on-device. No cloud AI is used anywhere in Orbit v1.
- No user accounts, sync, or remote backup in v1. The user's corpus is
  entirely on-device and survives only on that device (explicit export
  is the only portability).
- The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) and its 8
  principles are authoritative. Any conflict between this PRD and the
  constitution is resolved in favor of the constitution.
- Ripe Nudges, state-aware returns, calendar integration, Health Connect,
  and place-aware features are explicitly out of scope for v1 per the
  constitution's Phase 1 scope section.
- The existing spec 001-core-capture-overlay primitives remain in the
  codebase and are extended — not rewritten — by this PRD.

---

## Post-v1 Roadmap (informational — not in v1 scope)

This section summarizes the shape of post-v1 work so that v1
architectural decisions accommodate it. **Nothing here is v1 scope.**
The v1 build remains local-only per Principle I and the Phase 1 Scope
section of the constitution. Full specs for each item below live in the
numbered spec directories as they are drafted.

### Storage scope — what Orbit stores, where

Orbit stores seven distinct kinds of data. Each has its own tier
placement, encryption rule, and retention policy. Specs 006 (Orbit
Cloud), 007 (Knowledge Graph), 008 (Orbit Agent), and 009 (BYOC)
together implement this inventory.

1. **Captures (envelopes)** — body text, media references, OCR,
   transcripts, app/surface metadata, timestamps, state snapshots.
   Tier 0 local SQLCipher (source of truth). Per-user DEK for body
   and media on Tier 1. Originals stay on device by default; only
   thumbnails, OCR, and transcripts mirror to cloud unless the user
   explicitly uploads an original.
2. **Intent + actions** — intent label, confidence, model provenance,
   action taken, user feedback (kept/undone/edited/rated), skill
   invocation traces. Tier 0 + Tier 1. Audit anchor; feedback is the
   highest-signal training data.
3. **User profile** — modeled as a KG subgraph where `subject =
   user_id`. Three layers: (a) declared identity (name, locale,
   constraints, consented contacts); (b) inferred identity (style,
   recurring contacts, topic clusters) as bi-temporal triples; (c)
   corrections and rejections as negative-weight edges. Every fact
   has a sensitivity tag (`public_to_orbit`, `local_only`,
   `ephemeral`) and a share scope.
4. **Agent memory** — short-term session state (JSONB, high churn)
   for in-flight tasks; long-term patterns stored as KG nodes of
   type `Pattern` (low churn); plans with explicit state-machine
   columns; skill registry (installed AppFunctions, schemas,
   versions, usage stats, user-set defaults).
5. **Knowledge graph structure** — typed nodes (Person, Place,
   Project, Topic, Item, Event, State, Skill, Envelope, Pattern),
   bi-temporal edges (`valid_from`, `valid_to`, `invalidated_at`,
   `episode_id`), episodes (raw source linkage), user-editable
   ontology with audit, state-anchors, continuation-lineage edges.
6. **System/operational** — device registry, OAuth session tokens
   for Orbit Cloud, sync watermarks, plan/quota/billing, LLM usage
   meter, experiment flags, GDPR export/delete request state.
7. **External integrations** (post-v1) — OAuth tokens for
   user-connected services (calendar, email, messaging): Tier 0
   **only**, encrypted by Android Keystore, never uploaded.
   Derived facts (calendar events, contact relationships) flow to
   cloud as KG episodes only after the on-device `:agent` process
   applies the consent filter.

### Three-tier storage model

Orbit's storage model across all phases has exactly three tiers. Every
capability Orbit ships must work correctly at Tier 0, and Tiers 1 and 2
are purely additive.

- **Tier 0 — Local only (v1, always the default, always available).**
  SQLCipher-encrypted Room database on device, Android Keystore-wrapped
  passphrase, no network. Source of truth for capture, audit log, and
  consent ledger. Holds the last-N-days envelope projection for offline
  diary; holds OAuth tokens for any external integrations. Never
  turns off. FTS4 powers on-device keyword search in v1; no on-device
  vector DB in v1 (embeddings are computed locally via MediaPipe and
  uploaded to Tier 1 for similarity queries).
- **Tier 1 — Orbit Cloud managed (v1.1+, opt-in, default cloud path).**
  Orbit-operated managed PostgreSQL with pgvector. Each user gets a
  dedicated schema (`orbit_<user_id>`) with a dedicated database role;
  envelope bodies, media, transcripts, and `local_only` profile facts
  are stored ciphertext with a per-user DEK wrapped by KMS. Holds the
  full knowledge graph, user profile subgraph, agent long-term
  memory, and vector indexes. Constitution Principle X Model A;
  spec 006 is the authoritative contract. Users can export or delete
  all their cloud data at any moment without Orbit's involvement.
- **Tier 2 — BYOC sovereign (v1.3, opt-in power-user).** User
  provisions their own Postgres (Supabase, Neon, self-hosted,
  Hetzner, etc.) and Orbit writes the same schema as Tier 1 to their
  database. User holds admin access and pays their own provider
  bill. Migration in either direction (Tier 1 ↔ Tier 2) is lossless
  by construction — the schemas match. Constitution Principle X
  Model B; spec 009 is the authoritative contract.

**What is never stored above Tier 0**, regardless of user preference:
the audit log, the consent ledger, OAuth tokens for external
integrations, and any profile fact or KG node/edge tagged
`local_only`. These are structurally local-only, enforced in the
`:agent` process consent filter (Principle XI).

### Post-v1 feature roadmap

Each item below is a distinct feature branch. None blocks v1; all
depend on v1 having shipped and stabilized.

- **003 — Orbit Actions (v1.1).** Structured extraction from captured
  text (flight confirmations → calendar events; task lists → to-do
  items; weekly diary digest). Actions are invoked as AppFunctions so
  they compose with the agent (spec 008). All extraction is
  Nano-first with Orbit-managed LLM proxy or BYOK upgrade (Principle
  IX). Every action requires explicit user confirmation before
  writing to external apps. Tools run on-device; derived facts flow
  to cloud as KG episodes.
- **004 — Ask Orbit (v1.2).** Natural-language chat over the envelope
  corpus and knowledge graph. Hybrid retrieval (keyword on-device +
  vector in Tier 1 + KG traversal in Tier 1) + Nano or cloud
  synthesis through the consent-aware prompt assembly gate (Principle
  XI).
- **005 — Cloud Boost / LLM (v1.1).** Orbit-managed LLM proxy as the
  default cloud-LLM path (no API key required for users within
  quota). Per-capability BYOK toggles retained for power users.
  Keystore-wrapped key storage. Every cloud call audited locally.
  Falls back to Nano with zero feature loss if disabled.
- **006 — Orbit Cloud Storage (v1.1).** Orbit-hosted managed Postgres
  (schema-per-tenant, per-user DEK, pgvector). Default cloud storage
  tier. Replaces the former BYOC-first design. Authoritative contract
  for Tier 1.
- **007 — Knowledge Graph (v1.2).** Entity extraction, bi-temporal
  edges, continuation-lineage edges, state-anchored nodes,
  user-editable ontology with audit, temporal decay + reinforcement.
  User profile is modeled as a KG subgraph where `subject = user_id`
  using the same tables and the same queries.
- **008 — Orbit Agent (v1.2).** Planner + executor running in a
  dedicated `:agent` process. Invokes AppFunctions (spec 003) as
  tools. Holds short-term session memory (Postgres JSONB) and
  long-term patterns as KG `Pattern` nodes. Assembles prompts
  on-device through the consent filter (Principle XI). Bubble
  long-press triggers agent; action outcomes become episodes.
- **009 — BYOC Sovereign Storage (v1.3).** Paste-connection-string
  flow for user-owned Postgres. Same schema as spec 006. Lossless
  migration to/from Tier 1. Authoritative contract for Tier 2.

### v1 abstractions required by the roadmap

Two lightweight abstractions are introduced in v1 (not as user-visible
features) so that v1.1+ work is additive rather than a refactor:

- **`LlmProvider` interface** in `com.orbit.app.ai` with
  `NanoLlmProvider` as the sole v1 implementation. Every Nano call in
  v1 routes through this interface. v1.1 adds `OrbitManagedLlmProvider`
  (the managed proxy) and `ByokLlmProvider` without touching call
  sites. Every result carries a `LlmProvenance` field (`LOCAL_NANO`,
  `ORBIT_MANAGED(model)`, or `BYOK(provider, model)`) for audit
  purposes.
- **`EnvelopeStorageBackend` interface** behind `EnvelopeRepositoryImpl`
  with `LocalRoomBackend` as the sole v1 implementation. v1.1+ adds
  `OrbitCloudBackend` (Tier 1) and v1.3 adds `ByocPostgresBackend`
  (Tier 2) without touching the AIDL surface or callers.

These are documented in `specs/002-intent-envelope-and-diary/tasks.md`
as foundational tasks in Phase 2.
